## Advanced - Full stack web development

- [x] Computer networks (Don't need to go into heavy detail but an understanding is necessary)
### Backend web dev tools (This is for app logic and interfacing with databases etc).
- [x] Flask
- [x] Django
### Front end framework (This is for communicating with the backend)
- [ ] Angular 6+
- [ ] React/Redux (These are libraries not frameworks but most consider them a framework)
### With frontend you'll also need
- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] Javascript (also good to learn typescript which is used in angular. It makes writing Javascript nicer).
###vRelational database (Pick one and learn it, they're all quite similar)
- [x] MySQL
- [x] PostgreSQL
### Non-relational
- [x] MongoDB
- [ ] Apache Cassandra (Wide-Column)
### Caching Systems
- [ ] MemcacheD
- [ ] Redis
### Cloud Computing (Knowledge of cloud computing is important nowadays)
- [ ] AWS (Offers the most services and has a 1 year free tier)
- [ ] Google Cloud
- [ ] Azure
